	Pattern Matching:

		condic 1:
		
		+(type)
		case a:int => a+1

		[is not]   
		case 1     => assert 1 is not 1

		{.x,y->x+y == 5}
		case 4     => assert 1+4 == 5

		otherwise  => print("otherwise")
	Plus: Matching Filter:
		condic[] [1,2,3]: # use a seq as test expression , you should write "condic[] seq", "condic{} seq", "condic() seq".
			+(type)
			case (*a,b) -> a : list => sum(a)


	Arrow Transform

		>> range(5) -> map(.x->x+1, _) -> list(_)
		>> [1,2,3,4,5]
